Here, you find a manual how to get started with the new functionality wiener_full to use CDF and CCDF. 

!!IMPORTANT!! This manual only works for LINUX-systems (or subsystems like Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or  Virtual Machines). 
Only when the function is fully integrated into Stan, other operating systems can use the function.

In case of any question feel free to contact the authors Franziska Henrich (fh422@email.uni-freiburg.de).

The easiest way to use the function is via cmdstan. You can call cmdstan via cmdstanr in R.

You need to follow these steps: 

1) Clone the cmdstan-repository [1]:
	$ git clone https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan.git --recursive

2) In the new cmdstanfolder, go to the stan-math (stan/lib/stan_math) subdirectory, add a new remote repo (name it as you want, here: new_repo), fetch the branch, and switch to that branch:
	$ cd cmdstan/stan/lib/stan_math
	$ git remote add new_repo git@github.com:Franzi2114/math.git
	$ git fetch new_repo feature/issue-2966-Add-7-parameter-DDM-CDF-and-CCDF
	$ git checkout feature/issue-2966-Add-7-parameter-DDM-CDF-and-CCDF

3) Use the stanc.exe file in the folder. This is a precompiled file that should be copied to the following destination (in Linux without any extention):
	(Linux) 	cmdstan/bin/stanc
	(Windows)	cmdstan/bin/stanc.exe
   If permission denied on cmdstan/bin/stanc, set permissions with
	$ chmod +rwx cmdstan/bin/stanc

4) To test whether everything works, create a new_model.stan model file in cmdstan/stan/lib/stan_math/models (or use the example models provided in the folder) 
   and compile the model (!!without .stan-extension!!, see [2]):
	$ cd cmdstan
	$ make stan/lib/stan_math/models/new_model
